NOTE: The main class is Game, to play the game you need to run it from there.

NOTE: In order to finish the game in the fastest method, from entrace go:
east, east, answer the riddle (answer is "e"), north, north, west, west, west, west, north, north.
This path will bring you to a riddled door, and 2 bosses. You'll also be attacked by enemies.



NOTE: Going North in the Ruins area will reveal a secret optional path.
This area is very tough, long, and unnecessary, however we had the time to make it, so we did.
It was done only for fun.
The area adds 35 rooms on top of the 15 from the original "main" game.
I am very sorry if it takes a long time to go through it.


This is a video game that both Alex and I made. 
The game is a text adventure called "Dungeon Brawler".


The player explores an underground city using North South East and West to navigate.
Every time you move, you have a chance of encountering an enemy.


Certain rooms have bosses, very powerful enemies that you need to defeat in order to proceed.
These bosses drop keys.
In order to open certain doors in the game, you must retrieve these keys.


Enemies (and bosses) drop healing potions and gold. 
The healing potions allow the player to heal a certain amount of health, depending on the strength of the potion.
You can heal either during combat, or during free-roam.
You can only have 10 healing potions at any given time, and you cannot switch them out for other potions.
The coins on the other hand, are a points system. They provide no additional value to the game.


Combat works with probability.
The player character has a few options during their turn in combat.
They can either attack, block, or heal.
There is a chance that the player character misses an attack, and blocks don't always succeed.
Healing consumes one of your healing potions.
Enemies can also miss their attacks. Each enemy has a different probability to hit.
If the the player character takes 250 points of damage, they die.
The player character does 3 damage.
Enemies have varying health. For example: a troll will have more health than a cave bear.
During combat, if all you do is attack, you will most likely die. You need to block and heal as much as you attack.
Some enemies summon help when fighting you, if you attack when facing multiple enemies, you will attack each one separately.


There are optional paths in the game.
You do not need to go through certain areas of the game in order to reach the final boss.
Once you enter the chamber of the final boss, you cannot leave, so if you want to explore, do it before entering the room.
Once the final boss has been defeated, the game ends.


When exploring, by typing in "x" instead of directional keys, you can quit the game.
Dying will also end the game.



Aaron's father helped us with some main routines for the game, the data structure of the room, and organizing code.
He also taught us how to work with objects and classes.
